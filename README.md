# Hi, I'm Gerardo 👋
🎓 I graduated in **Computer Science** from the **University of Salerno**, completing both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees with a specialization in **Cloud Computing**.

💻 My passion for technology has always been strong. In fact, during my studies, I embarked on my journey as a developer.

💬 _My motto_:  
**"Never play for the audience"** – _Follow your passions, even if they're not always understood by others_.

🌱 I believe that true success lies in staying true to yourself and your interests, no matter how unconventional they may seem to others. 🚀

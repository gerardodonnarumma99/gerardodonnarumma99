### &gt; Hi, I'm Gerardo 👋 <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%">
I graduated in Computer Science from the University of Salerno, completing both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees with a specialization in Cloud Computing. My passion for technology has always been strong, and in fact, during my studies, I began my career as a developer. My motto is: "Never play for the audience" – Follow your passions, even if they're not always understood by others.
